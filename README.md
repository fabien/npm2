npm2
====

Like [npm3](https://npmjs.org/npm3), this package lets you run npm v2 when your main npm is npm v3.

Install
-------

Sadly, the name `npm2` is taken, so this isn't published to npm.

`npm install -g robrich/npm2`

This will install npm2 from GitHub.

Usage
-----

In all the places you need npm@2, type `npm2 install ...` instead of `npm install ...`.  Note the `2`.  This works for all the npm commands.

Thanks to [npm3](https://npmjs.org/npm3) who provided the inspiration and code to fork.
